This about-me project is an Astro-based portfolio/CV builder. It includes an admin UI to manage profile, experience, projects, and skills, and renders a polished, shareable site. Roadmap priorities: tabbed admin editor, inline editing, async form submissions, image uploads (user and projects), feature flags (gate image upload), multiple CV templates, and export to a single self-contained HTML (inlined CSS, base64 images, minimal JS). Tech: Astro, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, pnpm.

After each change, propose git commit message, which applies to all modified files
